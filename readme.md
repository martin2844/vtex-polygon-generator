# Polygon Generator

Generates polygons with a 9km diameter, specifically done for peya-vtex project.
Polygons are saved as a GEOJSON in a .json format

# How to use:

1. Git clone project
2. Run `npm i`
3. Fill in addresses at the address array in app.js
4. Run `node app.js`

## Important
Do not use nodemon. Nodemon will think that the .json files saved are changes and will run forever.
